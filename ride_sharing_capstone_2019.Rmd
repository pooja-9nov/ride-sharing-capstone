## üìä Project Overview

This project analyzes ride-sharing data for the year 2019. Using SQL and Tableau, I explored patterns in ride volume, user behavior, and time-based trends to uncover actionable insights for stakeholders.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- Google BigQuery (SQL) ‚Äì Data cleaning & transformation  
- RStudio (R Markdown) ‚Äì Documentation  
- Tableau Public ‚Äì Visualization

## üì• Step 1: Data Cleaning (SQL in BigQuery)

The data was first cleaned and transformed in BigQuery:

- Combined quarterly ride datasets into one (`2019Combined`)
- Extracted useful time features:
  - `trip_month`, `trip_hour`, `trip_day`, `trip_date`
- Converted `tripduration` from seconds to minutes
- Cleaned missing values in `gender` and `usertype`
- Calculated age from `birthyear`

**Sample SQL:**

```sql
SELECT
  *,
  ROUND(tripduration / 60.0, 2) AS tripduration_mins,
  DATE(start_time) AS trip_date,
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM start_time) AS trip_month,
  EXTRACT(HOUR FROM start_time) AS trip_hour,
  EXTRACT(DAY FROM start_time) AS trip_day,
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE()) - birthyear AS age,
  CASE
    WHEN gender IS NULL OR TRIM(gender) = '' THEN 'Unknown'
    ELSE gender
  END AS gender_cleaned,
  CASE
    WHEN usertype IS NULL OR TRIM(usertype) = '' THEN 'Unknown'
    ELSE usertype
  END AS usertype_cleaned
FROM
  `project.dataset.2019Combined`
```

## üîç Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 2.1 Monthly Ride Volume

```sql
SELECT
  FORMAT_DATE('%B', trip_date) AS month_name,
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_date) AS month_num,
  usertype_cleaned,
  COUNT(*) AS trip_rides
FROM
  `project.dataset.2019Combined_cleaned`
GROUP BY
  month_name, month_num, usertype_cleaned
ORDER BY
  month_num
```

### 2.2 Avg Trip Duration by Usertype

```sql
SELECT
  usertype_cleaned,
  ROUND(AVG(tripduration_mins), 2) AS avg_trip_duration_mins,
  COUNT(*) AS total_rides
FROM
  `project.dataset.2019Combined_cleaned`
GROUP BY
  usertype_cleaned
```

### 2.3 Peak Usage Heatmap: Day vs Hour

```sql
SELECT
  FORMAT_DATE('%A', trip_date) AS day_of_week,
  EXTRACT(HOUR FROM start_time) AS trip_hour,
  COUNT(*) AS trip_rides
FROM
  `project.dataset.2019Combined_cleaned`
GROUP BY
  day_of_week, trip_hour
```

## üìä Step 3: Tableau Dashboard

Visuals created in Tableau:

- Line Chart: Monthly Ride Volume by Usertype
- Bar Chart: Avg Trip Duration by Usertype (Monthly)
- Heatmap: Hour vs Day Ride Density
- Pie Chart: Gender or Usertype Share

## üí° Key Insights

- Customers take longer trips, but Subscribers take more rides
- Ride volume peaks during summer (June‚ÄìAugust)
- Weekday rush hours (7‚Äì9 AM) show highest usage
- Gender distribution shows slight skew toward [e.g. Male/Female]

---

## üíº Business Impact

- Marketing can target casual riders in summer months
- Product teams can improve service availability during peak hours
- Gender-specific campaigns may help balance usage

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of SQL for scalable data processing, Tableau for visual storytelling, and R Markdown for documentation ‚Äî showcasing full-stack data analysis skills.
